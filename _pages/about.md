I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Research Center for Statistics](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/institutes/rcs/) 
of the University of Geneva under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Sebastian Engelke](http://www.sengelke.com/). I obtained my Doctorate from the Techical University of Munich under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Matthias Scherer](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/mathfinance/staff/professors/prof-dr-matthias-scherer/). My current research interests include:

+ Statistical model comparison
+ Exchangeability and its application to non-parametric Bayesian survival analysis
+ Statistical inference for LÃ©vy processes
+ Extreme value theory
+ Use of machine learning in classical statistics.
